# Numenix

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still under development and primarily intended for personal use. I created it to deepen my understanding of Elixir and Phoenix while eliminating the need for managing my finances using Excel or Word documents.

**Origin of Name**

* **Numen** + **Elixir** -> Numen means a divinity, especially a local or presiding god.

**Project Goals**

* To gain proficiency in the Elixir/Phoenix programming languages.
* To develop a personal finance management application to track expenses, set financial goals, and monitor progress.

## PHOENIX

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
